							<h1 class="nospacing">Junior School</h1>
							<h3 class="nospacing">for children aged 6 to 11</h3>
							<h5><br/>It is nothing new to say that today we live in 
							a global world and so our daily pursuits aim at helping children to become successful, active and responsible citizens of the world.</h5>
						</div><!-- .intro -->
						
						<h6>What we teach</h6>
						
						<p>Our broad and balanced <strong>curriculum develops children academically</strong> in all subjects of primary curriculum. Next to subject learning it also focuses on every child’s <strong>personal development</strong> and development of their international minds.</p>

						<p>Last but not least, it is our aim to make the learning experience for every pupil exciting, fulfilling and something they will remember and <strong>look back at with joy</strong>.</p>
						
						<h6>Daily schedule</h6>
						
						<p>There is always a lot going on both inside and outside the classroom. Every school day follows a regular pattern. Children learn <strong>English and Math usually in the mornings</strong>. There are also Czech first language classes for children who are Czech nationals.</p>

						<p>The <strong>second half of the day is devoted to international learning</strong> with the International Primary Curriculum. Children work together in small mixed ability groups on researching and recording activities within integrated cross-curricular IPC Units of Work. Each unit of work is based on a specific theme and follows a rigorous structure.</p>

						<p>The main learning programme finishes usually at 14:00. After that some children stay at school to attend the <strong>after school club</strong> or the different after school activities which usually run from 14:00 to 15:00.</p>

						<h6>The curriculum</h6>
						
						<p>The main programme of the <strong>International Primary Curriculum</strong> together with the <strong>Cambridge International Primary Programme Curriculum Framework</strong> and the <strong>Czech National Curriculum Framework</strong> are the starting points on which we build a full and varied international curriculum at our school.</p>

						<p>The pupils not only experience a carefully structured and full curriculum in subjects of English and Mathematics but also in Science, Geography, History, Art, Music, Technology, ICT, Society and International mindedness taught as part of the theme based and <strong>exciting IPC Units of Work</strong>. Children who are Czech nationals also attend the Czech first language classes to meet the Czech statutory requirements.</p>

						<p>Pupils work towards the <strong>Primary Achievement Tests</strong> taken at the end of Milepost 3 (Year 6) and the Czech children also work towards <strong>regular examinations</strong> in Czech in order to maintain a smooth transition between the international and the Czech education systems. Throughout the Junior School, there are also <strong>internal assessments</strong> to measure childrenís achievement and progress term by term and year by year.</p>
						
						<h6>Admission process</h6>
						
						<p>Prior to offering a place at our school we would judge each child on a broad range of qualities. Our aim is to give places only to <strong>those who we feel would benefit most</strong> from the opportunities we offer. It is also not required from children to have a certain level of English.</p>

						<p>If possible we like all potential children to experience a half day with us. We may ask pupils wishing to enter Years 3, 4, 5 and 6 to sit <strong>short tests in Maths and English</strong> for setting purposes. The final decision to accept a child lies with the Headmaster. Generally, we can accommodate up to <strong>12 pupils in each of our Mileposts</strong> (two year groups).</p>
