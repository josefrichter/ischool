	<h6>The curriculum</h6>
	
	<p>The curriculum as well as the environment creates rich opportunities for children to <span class="strong">develop their international mindedness</span> in accordance with their overall development. In the Preschool the main language of instruction is English.</p>
	
	<p>The children in nursery and reception classrooms <span class="strong">learn through theme based units</span> that consist of various learning experiences and opportunities with a good balance of structured play, adult-initiated and child-initiated activities. <span class="strong">Each theme is well structured</span> as well as flexible enough to adjust to the needs and interest of each individual child to enable children of a young age develop at different rates and in different ways. <span class="strong">Play</span> is also regarded as an essential part of childrenâ€™s learning.</p>
	
	<p>By providing children with <span class="strong">'real' learning contexts</span> they are developing knowledge, skills and understanding in areas of social, personal and emotional development, language and communication, mathematical development, knowledge and understanding of the world, creative and physical development. At the <span class="strong">age of&nbsp;4</span> children are developing skills needed later on for <span class="strong">reading and writing</span> using the Jolly Phonic, Nelson English and the Oxford Reading Tree materials.</p>

	<h6>Daily schedule</h6>
	
	<p>Our preschool consists of one joint nursery (3 to 4 years old) and reception (4 to 5 years old) classrooms. The main program <span class="strong">starts at 8:45 and finishes at 14:30</span>. In addition, children can attend the <span class="strong">Breakfast and Afternoon Club</span> (7:30 to 8:45 and 14:30 to 16:30). In the afternoon, children can also take part in the <span class="strong">extra-curricular activities</span> such as the aerobic or music classes.</p>
	
	<p>During the day all children are offered various enjoyable learning activities to enhance different areas of their development that take place in the classroom, at the outdoor play area or in the gym. We strongly promote the <span class="strong">individual approach to each child</span> therefore the <span class="strong">staff/children ratio is 2/15</span> for the most of the day. We also organise <span class="strong">swimming and skiing lessons</span> as a part of the main program.</p>
